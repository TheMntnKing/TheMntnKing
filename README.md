### The Forge

I'm an engineer exploring how to build and break modern AI systems. This profile is my digital forgeâ€”a place for my experiments, open-source tools, and works-in-progress.


I'll be documenting my journey on my blog, **[bronzebeard.dev](https://bronzebeard.dev)**, which is currently under construction. Stay tuned.
