### The Forge

I'm an engineer exploring how to build and break modern AI systems. This profile is my digital forge—a place for my experiments, open-source tools, and works-in-progress.


I'll be documenting my journey on my blog, **[bronzebeard.dev](bronzebeard.dev)**, which is currently under construction. Stay tuned.


### The Anvil

- **[In Progress] Production-Ready RAG @ 1M+ Vectors:** Architecting a scalable and secure RAG pipeline. The goal is a public repository and a full technical write-up.
